# Header

* doesn't semi-transparent background look ok?
** overlaps with slide show buttons
* decrease height?


# Front Page

* Slideshow: Choose better images ... need to be wide, but work with both crop on height or widgth. Certinaly, a better Map Distribution slide? Or screenshot of Voice of Kibera?
* start with a different photo w.o map kibera logo
* "Making the Invisible Visible"
**  Map Kibera - Making the Invisible Visible
     Citizen Journalism - Letting their Voices Be Heard
     Engaging Nairobi and Kenya - Demanding to be seen
     Work with us - We develop programs and train
* The slide description text is not consistently easy to see against background.
* Slide copy needs improvement.
* give the header a dark bgcolor in slideshow? better text color?
* Introductory Copy needs improvement
* Page *could* end after slide show and welcome text
* Slides *could* cycle automatically
* Slide titles *could* be clickable
* add map as a slide

* Citizen Mapping / Media buttons link to other pages, but where? A highlights page or Work. And then Programs would show all the brands.

* make twitter more obvious

5. I like that the "tools" in text immediately brings you to the tools section in "Our Work." Splitting into Mapping Voice and Media makes sense here. I also like that these buttons transport you to the relevant portion of the page and are the same for the locations page.

Because you do allot the space to go into tools (mapping, voice, video) here, it makes it less necessary to present the citizen mapping and the citizen media on the home page. At the moment, they're awkwardly place between the banner and the copy and I think they split the focus of the page. If you want, we could use the citizen aspect under the "Tools" tab, and rename the buttons Citizen Mapping, Citizen Voice, Citizen Video for effect. Or else, I'd suggest dropping the whole idea.
