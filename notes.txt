# Front Page

* rename mailing list from "Former Donors"

** Introductory Copy needs improvement
** Page *could* end after slide show and welcome text
** Slides *could* cycle automatically
** Slide titles *could* be clickable
** add map as a slide

** Citizen Mapping / Media buttons link to other pages, but where? A highlights page or Work. And then Programs would show all the brands.

** make twitter more obvious

5. I like that the "tools" in text immediately brings you to the tools section in "Our Work." Splitting into Mapping Voice and Media makes sense here. I also like that these buttons transport you to the relevant portion of the page and are the same for the locations page.

Because you do allot the space to go into tools (mapping, voice, video) here, it makes it less necessary to present the citizen mapping and the citizen media on the home page. At the moment, they're awkwardly place between the banner and the copy and I think they split the focus of the page. If you want, we could use the citizen aspect under the "Tools" tab, and rename the buttons Citizen Mapping, Citizen Voice, Citizen Video for effect. Or else, I'd suggest dropping the whole idea.
