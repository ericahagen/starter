<h2>
The Map Kibera Trust is a Kenyan registered Trust, the organizational home of our work, founded in 2010. We're working for a world in which all people have equal ability to create and share information to influence their future. Pracitcally speaking, we're building a culture where digital story-telling, open data and geographic information lead to greater influence and representation for marginalized communities, especially in Kibera, Nairobi, and Kenya.

Stefano Marras did "Map Kibera Project" in 2008, worked with Kepha. Erica and I independently conceived and  started "Map Kibera" in 2009, unintentionally choosing a similar names (oops). We actually connected with Stefano very quickly in the start, and have been entirely cordial. Stefano introduced us to Kepha. I have brought up the possibility of "merging" the projects, since they are pretty similar in intention (though different in the operational details), and especially since Stefano is no longer active on it; but he feels he wants to maintain the seperate identity out of courtesy to the people he worked with back in.
