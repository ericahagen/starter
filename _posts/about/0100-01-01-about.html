    <h2>Three Countries, Three Cities</h2>
    <p>The South Asia Region (SAR) has traditionally been one of the least urbanized regions in the world, but today, movement from rural to urban environments is steadily increasing. It is estimated that the total urban population will increase from 449 million in 2007, to 913 million in 2025, and subsequently to 1.32 billion in 2050. In addition, the GDP of SAR’s urban agglomerations contributes 25 percent to the region’s GDP, and is expected to increase significantly over the coming years. </p>

	<p>Given the current size of the overall SAR population – 1.4 billion – the movement of people to cities has been unplanned and disruptive. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is home to 34 percent of the country’s population and is among the fastest growing cities in the world. Approximately 40 percent of those living in Dhaka are slum dwellers. A quarter of Nepal’s population live in cities, while 15 percent of Sri Lanka’s population is now concentrated in urban centers. Not only is the current and projected rate of urbanization significant, given the sheer size of the South Asian population and the conditions they live in, managing the migration of people from rural to urban areas is a key challenge across the region. </p>

	<p>The growth and high population density in SAR’s cities will continue to make them vulnerable to disasters if development is not properly managed. Only through a clear understanding of risks can policymakers promote their population’s long-term sustainable development. In light of this, the Open Cities Project will consolidate fragmented urban planning data across SAR. In addition, it will ensure that new data created will be shared on a single open-source platform that is accessible by all relevant stakeholders. The project will then leverage this data to create actionable, data-driven tools for decision-makers. Sharing data and creating open systems promotes transparency, accountability, and ensures a wide range of actors are able to participate in the challenge of building resilience. </p>
