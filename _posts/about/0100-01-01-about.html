<h2>
The Map Kibera Trust is a Kenyan registered Trust, the organizational home of our work, founded in 2010. We're working for a world in which all people have equal ability to create and share information to influence their future, by contributing to a culture where digital story-telling, open data and geographic information lead to greater influence and representation for marginalized communities, especially in Kibera, Nairobi, and Kenya.
