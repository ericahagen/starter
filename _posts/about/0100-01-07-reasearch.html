Map Kibera has had the privilege of working with progressive researchers of all levels of experience. Our core principle is that residents of slums like Kibera should directly access, generate and benefit from information produced in their community. For research, this boils down to

<ul>
<li>Design in Partnership
<li>Contribute concretely to the research subject
<li>Complement ongoing projects and schedule
<li>Avoid Survey Fatigue
<li>Publish data and results open access
</ul>
